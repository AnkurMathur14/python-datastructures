90. Subsets II

Generate all subsets of a set (Power set) without duplicates

Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible
subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]

Power Set: Power set P(S) of a set S is the set of all subsets of S.
For example S = {a, b, c} then P(s) = {{}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}.
If S has n elements in it then P(s) will have 2^n elements
We can use backtrack here, we have two choices first consider that element then donâ€™t consider that element.

Generating power set is basically generating combinations.
(nCr is number of combinations can be made by taking r items from total n items)

formula: nCr = n!/((n-r)! * r!)
Example:Power Set for {1,2,3} is {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {1,3} {1,2,3}} = 8 = 2^3

1) 3C0 = #combinations possible taking 0 items from 3 = 3! / ((3-0)! * 0!) = 1
2) 3C1 = #combinations possible taking 1 item from 3 = 3! / ((3-1)! * 1!) = 3
3) 3C2 = #combinations possible taking 2 items from 3 = 3! / ((3-2)! * 2!) = 3
4) 3C3 = #combinations possible taking 3 items from 3 = 3! / ((3-3)! * 3!) = 1
if you add above 4 it comes out 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8 = 2^3. So basically it turns out to be 2^n possible sets in a power
set of n items.

So in an algorithm if you are generating a power set with all these combinations, then its going to take time
proportional to 2^n. And so the time complexity is 2^n.
